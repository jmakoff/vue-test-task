## How to run the app?
### Install node.js
First of all you should install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). 

**IMPORTANT!** Make sure that version of `node.js` is at least 4 and version of `npm` is at least 3.0.0 

#### macOS
In case you're using macOS we suggest you to install it with [homebrew](https://brew.sh):
``` bash
brew install node
```

### Install dependencies
After that you need to run next commands in a directory with a project:
``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install
```

### Start the app
And finally to to start dev server run this in a directory with the app:
``` bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```

Main file for you to work with will be `src/components/todo.vue`.

In most cases when you'll change source code browser with refresh automatically, but sometimes in order to see changes you'll need to refresh it manually or even restart dev server. 

**IMPORTANT!** if you don't see the app running after completing all steps above up environment contact me so I can help you.
